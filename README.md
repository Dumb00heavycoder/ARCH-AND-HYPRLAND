# ARCH-HYPRLAND-
![MUSASHI](Colourscheme-and-wallpaper/Samurai.jpg)


I was tired of my old Linux Mint + i3 setup—it felt outdated, like living in a retro black & white movie. I craved something modern, sleek, and future-ready. That’s when I discovered Hyprland—a stunning, Wayland-based window manager that instantly felt like the future of Linux.

I jumped in, flashed the Arch ISO, and followed Mutahar’s guide… until I ditched it midway to install GNOME. But GNOME brought back the same bloated feel I left Windows for. Plus, I made the mistake of splitting my root and home partitions on a 256GB SSD, which quickly became a problem. So I wiped everything and started again—Arch install #2.

Still not satisfied, I went all in on minimalism with Arch install #3—just /boot, swap, and / partitions, no display manager, only Hyprland launched from TTY. Clean, fast, and exactly what I wanted.

Now the real fun begins: ricing Hyprland into my dream desktop setup.
